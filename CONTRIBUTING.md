This project is built using webpack so if you want to contribute make sure you have a basic understanding of it.

#### Building

Before starting make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.

First install the dependencies by typing:

```bash
npm install
```

You can use watch so that ItemSlide will be built as you make changes to the `/src` files:

```bash
npm run watch
```

Or build the project using:

```bash
npm run build
```
